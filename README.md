# OsuKeyboard
A nice little software that simulates the typing sound from Osu!

If you want to see how it looks, click [here](https://i.alexflipnote.dev/3rSb3XE.mp4) for a short demo.

## Download program
Click [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/OsuKeyboard/raw/master/osukeyboard.exe) to download it.
If Windows Defender comes up and warns you, the only reason it does such is due to unsigned software. (Not paying for that..)
